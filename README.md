# Credit-Score-EDA-Project
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) for a loan-providing company that serves urban customers. The company evaluates loan applications by assessing a client’s ability to repay the loan.
The objective of this case study is to identify patterns and risk factors that indicate potential difficulty in repaying loan installments. These insights can support data-driven decisions such as loan approval or rejection, loan amount adjustment, and risk-based interest rate assignment. The analysis ensures that creditworthy applicants are not wrongly rejected while managing financial risk effectively.
